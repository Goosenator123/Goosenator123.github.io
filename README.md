## Introduction

This repository is designed to host multiple websites using GitHub Pages. It is used for me to display my school projects or personal ones.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-website-repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd multi-website-repo
    ```

3. Explore the subdirectories to understand the structure of each website.

If you wish to view the project online, you can type goosenator123.github.io/(folder name). Replace "(folder name)" with the actual name of the folder you want to view.

## Websites

### PixelGuess

PixelGuess is a simple number guesser game with an 8-bit style. It has a highscore system that stores and display scores on Javascript's localStorage. The game also has music that are not made by me.

### QuackIn

QuackIn is a goose themed logIn / signUp page with a togglable dark mode and light mode. The web uses Javascript's localStorage to store users' info so that users can login after signing up. It also has multiple easter eggs and a single page after login in.
