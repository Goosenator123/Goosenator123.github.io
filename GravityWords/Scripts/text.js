let genevaConvention = `PRELIMINARY REMARKS The International Committee of the Red Cross has  from the outset  been the sponsor of the Geneva Convention for the protection of wounded military personnel  and of the humanitarian Conventions which supplement it  Each of these fundamental international agreements is inspired by respect for human personality and dignity  together  they establish the principle of disinterested aid to all victims of war without discrimination   to all those who  whether through wounds  capture or shipwreck  are no longer enemies but merely suffering and defenceless human beings  Throughout the years  the International Committee has laboured unremittingly for the greater protection in International Law of the individual against the hardships of war  it successively elaborated the humanitarian Conventions and adapted them to current needs  or instituted new ones  In the period between the two World Wars  the Committee s main achievement lay in the establishment of a number of draft Conventions  chief among which was the Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War  this was signed in the summer of      and  during the last conflict  protected millions of captives  Other new or revised draft Conventions were to have been submitted to a Diplomatic Conference which the Swiss Federal Council planned to convene early in      hostilities  unfortunately  intervened  The year      marked the close of a war waged on an unprecedented scale  the task had to be faced of developing and adapting the humanitarian elements of International Law in the light of the experience gained  The International Committee s proposals met with the early approval of Governments and National Red Cross Societies  and it immediately set to work  Three former Conventions had to be revised  the Geneva Convention of      for the Relief of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field  the Xth Hague Convention of      for the adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the Principles of the Geneva Convention  and the      Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War  Furthermore  there was urgent need for a Convention for the protection of civilians  the absence of which had  during the world conflict  led to such grievous consequences  THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS of    August         PRELIMINARY REMARKS The International Committee worked on the lines it had followed after the           War  First  it collected the fullest possible preliminary information on those aspects of International Law that required confirmation  enlargement  or amendment  then  with the help of experts from various countries  it prepared the revised and new drafts which were submitted  first  to an International Red Cross Conference  and then to a Diplomatic Conference empowered to give these treaties final validity  The first meeting of experts was held in October      and comprised the neutral members of the Mixed Medical Commissions which  during the conflict  had visited wounded or sick prisoners of war  to decide about their repatriation  The second meeting was the  Preliminary Conference of National Red Cross Societies for the study of the Conventions and of various problems relative to the Red Cross   which the International Committee convened at Geneva  in July and August       and before which the first drafts were laid  Having gathered the suggestions of Red Cross agencies on points which were within their particular fields  the Committee made a close study during the months that followed  and collected very full data on all matters dealt with in the proposed Conventions  Consultations included one  in March       with representatives of the religious and secular bodies which had collaborated with the Committee in giving spiritual and intellectual aid to victims of the War  From April    to           the  Conference of Government Experts for the study of Conventions for the Protection of War Victims  was held in Geneva  This was attended by seventy representatives of fifteen Governments which had held large numbers of prisoners and civilian internees during the War  and were therefore particularly experienced in the matters under discussion  Combining the Committee s proposals  the suggestions made by the Red Cross Societies  and drafts prepared by several Governments  the Conference agreed to the new texts proposed and to the first draft of a Convention for the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  The International Committee also sought the advice of several Governments which were not represented at the April Conference  some sent experts to Geneva in June       The drafts in preparation were also submitted by the Committee to a Special Commission of National Red Cross Societies  which met at Geneva in September of the same year  After careful editing early in the year  the Draft Conventions were sent by the Committee  in May       to all Governments and National Red Cross Societies  in preparation for the XVIIth International Red Cross Conference  This Conference sat in Stockholm from August    to           the representatives of fifty Governments and fifty two National Red Cross Societies were present  With some amendments  the drafts were adopted  THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF         After passing through the many preparatory stages briefly described  these texts were eventually taken as the sole Working Documents of the Diplomatic Conference of Geneva  out of these grew the      Geneva Conventions  The Diplomatic Conference for the Establishment of International Conventions for the Protection of Victims of War  convened by the Swiss Federal Council  as trustee of the Geneva Conventions  was held in Geneva from April    to August          Of the sixty three Governments represented at the Conference  fifty nine had sent plenipotentiaries  four sent observers only  Representatives of the International Committee were invited to participate in the capacity of experts  After four months of continuous debate  the Conference established the following four Conventions  which are given below  I  Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field  of August           II  Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded  Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea  of August           III  Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War  of August           IV  Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War  of August           The Conference at once divided into four Committees  the First  for the revision of Conventions I and II  the Second  for the revision of Convention III  Prisoners of War   the Third  to establish the new Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons  and lastly  the Joint Committee  to deal with provisions common to the four Conventions  Co ordination and Drafting Committees met towards the end of the Conference  to harmonize the four texts  When necessary  the Committees formed Working Parties  At the closing meeting  Delegations of the following States signed the Final Act  Afghanistan  Albania  Argentina  Australia  Austria  Belgium  Brazil  Bulgaria  Burma  Canada  Chile  China  Columbia  Costa Rica  Cuba  Czechoslovakia  Denmark  Ecuador  Egypt  Ethiopia  Finland  France  Greece  Guatemala  the Holy See  Hungary  India  Iran  Ireland  Israel  Italy  Jugoslavia  Lebanon  Liechtenstein  Luxemburg  Mexico  Monaco  Netherlands  New Zealand  Nicaragua  Norway  Pakistan  Peru  Poland  Portugal  Rumania  Siam  Soviet Socialist Republic of Bielorussia  Soviet Socialist Republic of Ukraine  Spain  Sweden  Syria  Turkey  Union of Soviet Socialist Republics  United Kingdom  United States of America  Uruguay  Switzerland     PRELIMINARY REMARKS Seventeen Delegations also signed the four Conventions  forty four other States had signed when the agreed six months period expired on February           According to their provisions  the new Geneva Conventions come into force six months after the deposit of at least two instruments of ratification  Thereafter  they come into force for each Contracting Party six months after it ratifies  PROVISIONS COMMON TO THE FOUR CONVENTIONS The Geneva Diplomatic Conference made an innovation in grouping together and amplifying the common provisions  up to then dispersed and rudimentary  Now practically identical in the four Conventions  they may be considered under three headings  General Provisions The General Provisions are given in a dozen Articles of great importance at the beginning of each Convention  laying down the mode of application  They deal with respect for the Conventions and their application in international conflict  enemy occupation or civil war  They are followed by provisions about the duration of application  special agreements which Contracting Parties may conclude  the inalienability of the right of protected persons  the duties of Protecting Powers or their substitutes  the activities of the International Committee of The Red Cross  and conciliation procedure between the Contracting Parties  Repression of Breaches of the Conventions  Articles    to    of the First Convention     to    of the Second      to     of the Third  and     to     of the Fourth   The Stockholm Conference had expressed the view that the provisions it had approved were still inadequate  and had requested the International Committee to continue its study of this important question  After consulting lawyers of international repute  the Committee prepared suggestions which appeared in the volume  Remarks and Proposals   submitted for consideration  The Conference used these suggestions as a basis for its deliberations  The first of the Articles imposes penal sanctions for breaches of the Convention  in particular for  grave breaches   as defined in the succeeding Article  These texts will doubtless be an important contribution towards defining  war crimes  in International Law  The term is frequently used and seen in print  but still awaits an acceptable legal definition  THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS OF         Final Provisions The Final Provisions appear at the end of each Convention and define the procedure for the signature  ratification and entry into force of the Conventions  and for accession to them  FIRST GENEVA CONVENTION  WOUNDED AND SICK   The traditional  Geneva Convention   brought into being by the newly created International Committee of the Red Cross in       is the source of the  Geneva Conventions  which are now universally accepted  The original Convention gave the impetus to the Red Cross movement throughout the world  it likewise inspired the impulsion in International Law towards an increasing regulationand  eventually  the restriction and final prohibition   of war itself  This first international treaty  the fundamental principles of which have remained unshaken  was nevertheless marked by omissions and imperfections  and as early as four years after signature  a Conference was convened to discuss its revision  On October           the Conference proposed a number of additional Articles  providing in particular for the extension of the Convention to maritime warfare  but they were never ratified  A recommendation by the First Hague Conference in      raised the question of revision again  The      Diplomatic Conference established a revised text which recast and considerably developed the      text  After the First World War  it was clear that the Geneva Conventions needed adapting to the conditions of modern warfare  During the      Diplomatic Conference at Geneva  the text was once more revised  although to a lesser extent than on the first occasion  In       after renewed discussion by a Commission of international Experts called by the International Committee  another revised text was established  The draft  after submission to the XVIth International Red Cross Conference  London  I      was placed on the agenda of the Diplomatic Conference planned for      but postponed by the Second World War  We have shown how the      draft was shaped by the experience of the six momentous war years  The help of the National Red Cross Societies  closely involved historically in the application and development of the Convention  was particularly valuable`

let holyBible = `THE BOOK OF GENESIS  This book is so called from its treating of the GENERATION  that is  of the creation and the beginning of the world  The Hebrews call it BERESITH  from the Word with which it begins  It contains not only the history of the Creation of the world  but also an account of its progress during the space of      years  that is  until the death of JOSEPH    Genesis Chapter    God createth Heaven and Earth  and all things therein  in six days        In the beginning God created heaven  and earth        And the earth was void and empty  and darkness was upon the face of the deep  and the spirit of God moved over the waters        And God said  Be light made  And light was made        And God saw the light that it was good  and he divided the light from the darkness        And he called the light Day  and the darkness Night  and there was evening and morning one day        And God said  Let there be a firmament made amidst the waters  and let it divide the waters from the waters   A firmament    By this name is here understood the whole space between the earth  and the highest stars  The lower part of which divideth the waters that are upon the earth  from those that are above in the clouds        And God made a firmament  and divided the waters that were under the firmament  from those that were above the firmament  and it was so        And God called the firmament  Heaven  and the evening and morning were the second day        God also said  Let the waters that are under the heaven  be gathered together into one place  and let the dry land appear  And it was so done         And God called the dry land  Earth  and the gathering together of the waters  he called Seas  And God saw that it was good         And he said  let the earth bring forth green herb  and such as may seed  and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind  which may have seed in itself upon the earth  And it was so done         And the earth brought forth the green herb  and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind  and the tree that beareth fruit  having seed each one according to its kind  And God saw that it was good         And the evening and the morning were the third day         And God said  Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven  to divide the day and the night  and let them be for signs  and for seasons  and for days and years         To shine in the firmament of heaven  and to give light upon the earth  and it was so done         And God made two great lights  a greater light to rule the day  and a lesser light to rule the night  and the stars   Two great lights    God created on the first day  light  which being moved from east to west  by its rising and setting  made morning and evening  But on the fourth day he ordered and distributed this light  and made the sun  moon  and stars  The moon  though much less than the stars  is here called a great light  from its giving a far greater light to the earth than any of them         And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth         And to rule the day and the night  and to divide the light and the darkness  And God saw that it was good         And the evening and morning were the fourth day         God also said  let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life  and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven         And God created the great whales  and every living and moving creature  which the waters brought forth  according to their kinds  and every winged fowl according to its kind  And God saw that it was good         And he blessed them  saying  Increase and multiply  and fill the waters of the sea  and let the birds be multiplied upon the earth         And the evening and morning were the fifth day         And God said  Let the earth bring forth the living creature in its kind  cattle and creeping things  and beasts of the earth  according to their kinds  And it was so done         And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds  and cattle  and every thing that creepeth on the earth after its kind  And God saw that it was good         And he said  Let us make man to our image and likeness  and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea  and the fowls of the air  and the beasts  and the whole earth  and every creeping creature that moveth upon the earth   Let us make man to our image    This image of God in man  is not in the body  but in the soul  which is a spiritual substance  endued with understanding and free will  God speaketh here in the plural number  to insinuate the plurality of persons in the Deity         And God created man to his own image  to the image of God he created him  male and female he created them         And God blessed them  saying  Increase and multiply  and fill the earth  and subdue it  and rule over the fishes of the sea  and the fowls of the air  and all living creatures that move upon the earth   Increase and multiply    This is not a precept  as some Protestant controvertists would have it  but a blessing  rendering them fruitful  for God had said the same words to the fishes  and birds   ver      who were incapable of receiving a precept         And God said  Behold I have given you every herb bearing seed upon the earth  and all trees that have in themselves seed of their own kind  to be your meat         And to all beasts of the earth  and to every fowl of the air  and to all that move upon the earth  and wherein there is life  that they may have to feed upon  And it was so done         And God saw all the things that he had made  and they were very good  And the evening and morning were the sixth day   Genesis Chapter    God resteth on the seventh day and blesseth it  The earthly paradise  in which God placeth man  He commandeth him not to eat of the tree of knowledge  And formeth a woman of his rib        So the heavens and the earth were finished  and all the furniture of them        And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made  and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done   He rested  etc    That is  he ceased to make or create any new kinds of things  Though  as our Lord tells us  John        He still worketh   viz   by conserving and governing all things  and creating souls        And he blessed the seventh day  and sanctified it  because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made        These are the generations of the heaven and the earth  when they were created  in the day that the Lord God made the heaven and the earth        And every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth  and every herb of the ground before it grew  for the Lord God had not rained upon the earth  and there was not a man to till the earth        But a spring rose out of the earth  watering all the surface of the earth        And the Lord God formed man of the slime of the earth  and breathed into his face the breath of life  and man became a living soul        And the Lord God had planted a paradise of pleasure from the beginning  wherein he placed man whom he had formed        And the Lord God brought forth of the ground all manner of trees  fair to behold  and pleasant to eat of  the tree of life also in the midst of paradise  and the tree of knowledge of good and evil   The tree of life    So called because it had that quality  that by eating of the fruit of it  man would have been preserved in a constant state of health  vigour  and strength  and would not have died at all  The tree of knowledge    To which the deceitful serpent falsely attributed the power of imparting a superior kind of knowledge  beyond that which God was pleased to give         And a river went out of the place of pleasure to water paradise  which from thence is divided into four heads         The name of the one is Phison  that is it which compasseth all the land of Hevilath  where gold groweth         And the gold of that land is very good  there is found bdellium  and the onyx stone         And the name of the second river is Gehon  the same is it that compasseth all the land of Ethiopia         And the name of the third river is Tigris  the same passeth along by the Assyrians  And the fourth river is Euphrates         And the Lord God took man  and put him into the paradise of pleasure  to dress it  and to keep it         And he commanded him  saying  Of every tree of paradise thou shalt eat         But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil  thou shalt not eat  For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it  thou shalt die the death         And the Lord God said  It is not good for man to be alone  let us make him a help like unto himself         And the Lord God having formed out of the ground all the beasts of the earth  and all the fowls of the air  brought them to Adam to see what he would call them  for whatsoever Adam called any living creature the same is its name         And Adam called all the beasts by their names  and all the fowls of the air  and all the cattle of the field  but for Adam there was not found a helper like himself         Then the Lord God cast a deep sleep upon Adam  and when he was fast asleep  he took one of his ribs  and filled up flesh for it         And the Lord God built the rib which he took from Adam into a woman  and brought her to Adam         And Adam said  This now is bone of my bones  and flesh of my flesh  she shall be called woman  because she was taken out of man         Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother  and shall cleave to his wife  and they shall be two in one flesh         And they were both naked  to wit  Adam and his wife  and were not ashamed   Genesis Chapter    The serpent's craft  The fall of our first parents  Their punishment  The promise of a Redeemer        Now the serpent was more subtle than any of the beasts of the earth which the Lord God had made  And he said to the woman  Why hath God commanded you  that you should not eat of every tree of paradise        And the woman answered him  saying  Of the fruit of the trees that are in paradise we do eat        But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of paradise  God hath commanded us that we should not eat  and that we should not touch it  lest perhaps we die        And the serpent said to the woman  No  you shall not die the death        For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof  your eyes shall be opened  and you shall be as Gods  knowing good and evil        And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat  and fair to the eyes  and delightful to behold  and she took of the fruit thereof  and did eat  and gave to her husband  who did eat        And the eyes of them both were opened  and when they perceived themselves to be naked  they sewed together fig leaves  and made themselves aprons   And the eyes  etc    Not that they were blind before   for the woman saw that the tree was fair to the eyes  ver      nor yet that their eyes were opened to any more perfect knowledge of good  but only to the unhappy experience of having lost the good of original grace and innocence  and incurred the dreadful evil of sin  From whence followed a shame of their being naked  which they minded not before  because being now stript of original grace  they quickly began to be subject to the shameful rebellions of the flesh        And when they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in paradise at the afternoon air  Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God  amidst the trees of paradise        And the Lord God called Adam  and said to him  Where art thou         And he said  I heard thy voice in paradise  and I was afraid  because I was naked  and I hid myself         And he said to him  And who hath told thee that thou wast naked  but that thou hast eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat         And Adam said  The woman  whom thou gavest me to be my companion  gave me of the tree  and I did eat         And the Lord God said to the woman  Why hast thou done this  And she answered  The serpent deceived me  and I did eat         And the Lord God said to the serpent  Because thou hast done this thing  thou art cursed among all cattle  and beasts of the earth  upon thy breast shalt thou go  and earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life         I will put enmities between thee and the woman  and thy seed and her seed  she shall crush thy head  and thou shalt lie in wait for her heel   She shall crush    Ipsa  the woman  so divers of the fathers read this place  conformably to the Latin  others read it ipsum  viz   the seed  The sense is the same  for it is by her seed  Jesus Christ  that the woman crushes the serpent's head         To the woman also he said  I will multiply thy sorrows  and thy conceptions  in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children  and thou shalt be under thy husband's power  and he shall have dominion over thee         And to Adam he said  Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife  and hast eaten of the tree  whereof I commanded thee  that thou shouldst not eat  cursed is the earth in thy work  with labour and toil shalt thou eat thereof all the days of thy life         Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee  and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth         In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the earth out of which thou wast taken  for dust thou art  and into dust thou shalt return         And Adam called the name of his wife Eve  because she was the mother of all the living         And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skins  and clothed them         And he said  Behold Adam is become as one of us  knowing good and evil  now therefore lest perhaps he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life  and eat  and live for ever   Behold Adam  etc    This was spoken by way of reproaching him with his pride  in affecting a knowledge that might make him like to God         And the Lord God sent him out of the paradise of pleasure  to till the earth from which he was taken         And he cast out Adam  and placed before the paradise of pleasure Cherubims  and a flaming sword  turning every way  to keep the way of the tree of life   Genesis Chapter    The history of Cain and Abel        And Adam knew Eve his wife  who conceived and brought forth Cain  saying  I have gotten a man through God        And again she brought forth his brother Abel  And Abel was a shepherd  and Cain a husbandman        And it came to pass after many days  that Cain offered  of the fruits of the earth  gifts to the Lord        Abel also offered of the firstlings of his flock  and of their fat  and the Lord had respect to Abel  and to his offerings   Had respect    That is  shewed his acceptance of his sacrifice  as coming from a heart full of devotion   and that  as we may suppose  by some visible token  such as sending fire from heaven upon his offerings        But to Cain and his offerings he had no respect  and Cain was exceeding angry  and his countenance fell        And the Lord said to him  Why art thou angry  and why is thy countenance fallen        If thou do well  shalt thou not receive  but if ill  shall not sin forthwith be present at the door  but the lust thereof shall be under thee  and thou shalt have dominion over it        And Cain said to Abel his brother  Let us go forth abroad  And when they were in the field  Cain rose up against his brother Abel  and slew him        And the Lord said to Cain  Where is thy brother Abel  And he answered  I know not  am I my brother's keeper         And he said to him  What hast thou done  the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the earth         Now  therefore  cursed shalt thou be upon the earth  which hath opened her mouth and received the blood of thy brother at thy hand         When thou shalt till it  it shall not yield to thee its fruit  a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be upon the earth         And Cain said to the Lord  My iniquity is greater than that I may deserve pardon         Behold thou dost cast me out this day from the face of the earth  and from thy face I shall be hid  and I shall be a vagabond and a fugitive on the earth  every one  therefore  that findeth me  shall kill me   Every one that findeth me shall kill me    His guilty conscience made him fear his own brothers and nephews  of whom  by this time  there might be a good number upon the earth  which had now endured near     years  as may be gathered from Gen       compared with chap        though in the compendious account given in the scriptures  only Cain and Abel are mentioned         And the Lord said to him  No  it shall not so be  but whosoever shall kill Cain  shall be punished sevenfold  And the Lord set a mark upon Cain  that whosoever found him should not kill him   Set a mark  etc    The more common opinion of the interpreters of holy writ supposes this mark to have been a trembling of the body  or a horror and consternation in his countenance         And Cain went out from the face of the Lord  and dwelt as a fugitive on the earth at the east side of Eden         And Cain knew his wife  and she conceived  and brought forth Henoch  and he built a city  and called the name thereof by the name of his son Henoch   His wife    She was a daughter of Adam  and Cain's own sister  God dispensing with such marriages in the beginning of the world  as mankind could not otherwise be propagated  He built a city  viz    In process of time  when his race was multiplied  so as to be numerous enough to people it  For in the many hundred years he lived  his race might be multiplied even to millions         And Henoch begot Irad  and Irad begot Maviael  and Maviael begot Mathusael  and Mathusael begot Lamech         Who took two wives  the name of the one was Ada  and the name of the other Sella         And Ada brought forth Jabel  who was the father of such as dwell in tents  and of herdsmen         And his brother's name was Jubal  he was the father of them that play upon the harp and the organs         Sella also brought forth Tubalcain  who was a hammerer and artificer in every work of brass and iron  And the sister of Tubalcain was Noema         And Lamech said to his wives Ada and Sella  Hear my voice  ye wives of Lamech  hearken to my speech  for I have slain a man to the wounding of myself  and a stripling to my own bruising   I have slain a man  etc    It is the tradition of the Hebrews  that Lamech in hunting slew Cain  mistaking him for a wild beast  and that having discovered what he had done  he beat so unmercifully the youth  by whom he was led into that mistake  that he died of the blows         Sevenfold vengeance shall be taken for Cain  but for Lamech seventy times sevenfold         Adam also knew his wife again  and she brought forth a son  and called his name Seth  saying  God hath given me another seed for Abel  whom Cain slew         But to Seth also was born a son  whom he called Enos  this man began to call upon the name of the Lord   Began to call upon  etc    Not that Adam and Seth had not called upon God  before the birth of Enos  but that Enos used more solemnity in the worship and invocation of God   Genesis Chapter    The genealogy  age  and death of the Patriarchs  from Adam to Noe  The translation of Henoch        This is the book of the generation of Adam  In the day that God created man  he made him to the likeness of God        He created them male and female  and blessed them  and called their name Adam  in the day when they were created        And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years  and begot a son to his own image and likeness  and called his name Seth        And the days of Adam  after he begot Seth  were eight hundred years  and he begot sons and daughters        And all the time that Adam lived  came to nine hundred and thirty years  and he died        Seth also lived a hundred and five years  and begot Enos        And Seth lived after he begot Enos  eight hundred and seven years  and begot sons and daughters        And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years  and he died        And Enos lived ninety years  and begot Cainan         After whose birth he lived eight hundred and fifteen years  and begot sons and daughters         And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years  and he died         And Cainan lived seventy years  and begot Malaleel         And Cainan lived after he begot Malaleel  eight hundred and forty years  and begot sons and daughters         And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years  and he died         And Malaleel lived sixty five years and begot Jared         And Malaleel lived after he begot Jared  eight hundred and thirty years  and begot sons and daughters         And all the days of Malaleel were eight hundred and ninety five years  and he died         And Jared lived a hundred and sixty two years  and begot Henoch         And Jared lived after he begot Henoch  eight hundred years  and begot sons and daughters         And all the days of Jared were nine hundred and sixty two years  and he died         And Henoch lived sixty five years  and begot Mathusala         And Henoch walked with God  and lived after he begot Mathusala  three hundred years  and begot sons and daughters         And all the days of Henoch were three hundred and sixty five years         And he walked with God  and was seen no more  because God took him         And Mathusala lived a hundred and eighty seven years  and begot Lamech         And Mathlusala lived after he begot Lamech  seven hundred and eighty two years  and begot sons and daughters         And all the days of Mathusala were nine hundred and sixty nine years  and he died         And Lamech lived a hundred and eighty two years  and begot a son         And he called his name Noe  saying  This same shall comfort us from the works and labours of our hands on the earth  which the Lord hath cursed         And Lamech lived after he begot Noe  five hundred and ninety five years  and begot sons and daughters         And all the days of Lamech came to seven hundred and seventy seven years  and he died  And Noe  when he was five hundred years old  begot Sem  Cham  and Japheth   Genesis Chapter    Man's sin is the cause of the deluge  Noe is commanded to build the ark        And after that men began to be multiplied upon the earth  and daughters were born to them        The sons of God seeing the daughters of men  that they were fair  took to themselves wives of all which they chose   The sons of God    The descendants of Seth and Enos are here called sons of God from their religion and piety  whereas the ungodly race of Cain  who by their carnal affections lay grovelling upon the earth  are called the children of men  The unhappy consequence of the former marrying with the latter  ought to be a warning to Christians to be very circumspect in their marriages  and not to suffer themselves to be determined in their choice by their carnal passion  to the prejudice of virtue or religion        And God said  My spirit shall not remain in man for ever  because he is flesh  and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years   His days shall be  etc    The meaning is  that man's days  which before the flood were usually     years  should now be reduced to     years  Or rather  that God would allow men this term of     years  for their repentance and conversion  before he would send the deluge        Now giants were upon the earth in those days  For after the sons of God went in to the daughters of men  and they brought forth children  these are the mighty men of old  men of renown   Giants    It is likely the generality of men before the flood were of a gigantic stature in comparison with what men now are  But these here spoken of are called giants  as being not only tall in stature  but violent and savage in their dispositions  and mere monsters of cruelty and lust        And God seeing that the wickedness of men was great on the earth  and that all the thought of their heart was bent upon evil at all times        It repented him that he had made man on the earth  And being touched inwardly with sorrow of heart   It repented him  etc    God  who is unchangeable  is not capable of repentance  grief  or any other passion  But these expressions are used to declare the enormity of the sins of men  which was so provoking as to determine their Creator to destroy these his creatures  whom before he had so much favoured        He said  I will destroy man  whom I have created  from the face of the earth  from man even to beasts  from the creeping thing even to the fowls of the air  for it repenteth me that I have made them        But Noe found grace before the Lord        These are the generations of Noe  Noe was a just and perfect man in his generations  he walked with God`
