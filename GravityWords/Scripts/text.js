let shrekMovie = `Man Once upon a time there was a lovely princess

But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort which could only 

be broken by loves first kiss

She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible firebreathing 

dragon

Many brave knigts had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison 

but non prevailed

She waited in the dragons keep in the highest room of the tallest 

tower for her true love and true loves first kiss

Laughing 

Like thats ever gonna happen

Paper Rusting Toilet Flushes

What a load of  



Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me

I aint the sharpest tool in the shed

She was lookin kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb

In the shape of an L on her forehead

The years start comin and they dont stop comin

Fed to the rules and hit the ground runnin

Didnt make sense not to live for fun

Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

Only shootin stars break the mold

Youre bundled up now but wait till you get older

But the meteor men beg to differ

Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

The ice we skate is gettin pretty thin

The waters getting warm so you might as well swim

My worlds on fire

How bout yours

Thats the way I like it and Ill never get bored

Hey now youre an allstar

RefugeesFor similar topics see Geneva Protocol disambiguationThe Geneva Convention the signatureandseals page of the  Geneva Convention that established humane rules of warOriginal document as PDF in single pages The Geneva Conventions comprise four treaties and three additional protocols that establish the standards of international law for humanitarian treatment in war The singular term Geneva Convention usually denotes the agreements of  negotiated in the aftermath of the Second World War  which updated the terms of the two  treaties and added two new conventions The Geneva Conventions extensively defined the basic rights of wartime prisoners civilians and military personnel established protections for the wounded and sick and established protections for the civilians in and around a warzone The treaties of  were ratified in whole or with reservations by  countries Moreover the Geneva Convention also defines the rights and protections afforded to noncombatants yet because the Geneva Conventions are about people in war the articles do not address warfare properthe use of weapons of warwhich is the subject of the Hague Conventions First Hague Conference  Second Hague Conference  and the biochemical warfare Geneva Protocol Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating Poisonous or other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare ContentsshowHistoryeditProgression of Geneva Conventions from  to Red Cross poster from the First World WarThe Swiss businessman Henry Dunant went to visit wounded soldiers after the Battle of Solferino in  He was shocked by the lack of facilities personnel and medical aid available to help these soldiers As a result he published his book A Memory of Solferino in  on the horrors of war His wartime experiences inspired Dunant to proposeA permanent relief agency for humanitarian aid in times of warA government treaty recognizing the neutrality of the agency and allowing it to provide aid in a war zoneThe former proposal led to the establishment of the Red Cross in Geneva The latter led to the  Geneva Convention the first codified international treaty that covered the sick and wounded soldiers in the battlefield On  August  the Swiss government invited the governments of all European countries as well as the United States Brazil and Mexico to attend an official diplomatic conference Sixteen countries sent a total of twentysix delegates to Geneva On  August  the conference adopted the first Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field Representatives of  states and kingdoms signed the convention Swiss Confederation Grand Duchy of Baden Kingdom of Belgium Kingdom of Denmark Second French Empire Grand Duchy of Hesse Kingdom of Italy Kingdom of the Netherlands Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves Kingdom of Prussia Kingdom of Spain Kingdom of WrttembergFor both of these accomplishments Henry Dunant became corecipient of the first Nobel Peace Prize in On  October  the first unsuccessful attempt to expand the  treaty was undertaken With the Additional Articles relating to the Condition of the Wounded in War an attempt was undertaken to clarify some rules of the  convention and to extend them to maritime warfare The Articles were signed but never ratified by all parties Only the Netherlands and the United States ratified the Articles The Netherlands later withdrew their ratification The protection of the victims of maritime warfare would later be realized by the third Hague Convention of  and the tenth Hague Convention of In  thirtyfive states attended a conference convened by the Swiss government On  July  it resulted in the adoption of the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field which improved and supplemented for the first time the  convention It remained in force until  when Costa Rica acceded to the  Geneva ConventionsThe  conference yielded two conventions that were signed on  July  One the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field was the third version to replace the original convention of  The other was adopted after experiences in World War I had shown the deficiencies in the protection of prisoners of war under the Hague Conventions of  and  The Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War was not to replace these earlier conventions signed at The Hague rather it supplemented themInspired by the wave of humanitarian and pacifistic enthusiasm following World War II and the outrage towards the war crimes disclosed by the Nuremberg Trials a series of conferences were held in  reaffirming expanding and updating the prior Geneva and Hague Conventions It yielded four distinct conventionsThe First Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field was the fourth update of the original  convention and replaced the  convention on the same subject matterThe Second Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea replaced the Hague Convention X of  It was the first Geneva Convention on the protection of the victims of maritime warfare and mimicked the structure and provisions of the First Geneva ConventionThe Third Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War replaced the  Geneva Convention that dealt with prisoners of warIn addition to these three conventions the conference also added a new elaborate Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War It was the first Geneva Convention not to deal with combatants rather it had the protection of civilians as its subject matter The  and  Hague Conventions had already contained some provisions on the protection of civilians and occupied territory Article  specifically provides that the Fourth Geneva Convention is supplementary to these provisions in the Hague ConventionsDespite the length of these documents they were found over time to be incomplete In fact the very nature of armed conflicts had changed with the beginning of the Cold War era leading many to believe that the  Geneva Conventions were addressing a largely extinct reality on the one hand most armed conflicts had become internal or civil wars while on the other most wars had become increasingly asymmetric Moreover modern armed conflicts were inflicting an increasingly higher toll on civilians which brought the need to provide civilian persons and objects with tangible protections in time of combat thus bringing a much needed update to the Hague Conventions of  and  In light of these developments two Protocols were adopted in  that extended the terms of the  Conventions with additional protections In  a third brief Protocol was added establishing an additional protective sign for medical services the Red Crystal as an alternative to the ubiquitous Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems for those countries that find them objectionableCommentarieseditThe Geneva Conventions of  August  Commentary The Commentaries is a series of four volumes of books published between  and  and containing commentaries to each of the four Geneva Conventions The series was edited by Jean Pictet who was the vicepresident of the International Committee of the Red Cross The Commentaries are often relied upon to provide authoritative interpretation of the articlesContentsedit Parties to

and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea prisoners of war and civilians The first convention dealt with the treatment of wounded and sick armed forces in the field The second convention dealt with the sick wounded and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea The third convention dealt with the treatment of prisoners of war during times of conflict The fourth convention dealt with the

ConflictsProtocol II  relating to the Protection of Victims of NonInternational Armed ConflictsProtocol III  relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive EmblemApplicationeditThe Geneva Conventions apply at times of war and armed conflict to governments who have ratified its terms The details of applicability are spelled out in Common Articles  and  The topic of applicability has generated some controversy When the Geneva Conventions apply governments have surrendered some of their national sovereignty by signing these treatiesCommon Article  relating to international armed conflictseditThis article states that the Geneva Conventions apply to all cases of international conflict where at least one of the warring nations have ratified the Conventions PrimarilyThe Conventions apply to all cases of declared war between signatory nations This is the original sense of applicability which predates the  versionThe Conventions apply to all cases of armed conflict between two or more signatory nations even in the absence of a declaration of war This language was added in  to accommodate situations that have all the characteristics of war without the existence of a formal declaration of war such as a police actionThe Conventions apply to a signatory nation even if the opposing nation is not a signatory but only if the opposing nation accepts and applies the provisions of the ConventionsArticle  of Protocol I further clarifies that armed conflict against colonial domination and foreign occupation also qualifies as an international conflictWhen the criteria of international conflict have been met the full protections of the Conventions are considered to applyCommon Article  relating to noninternational armed conflicteditThis article states that the certain minimum rules of war apply to armed conflicts  where at least one Party is not a State The interpretation of the term armed conflict and therefore the applicability of this article is a matter of debate For example it would apply to conflicts between the Government and rebel forces or between two rebel forces or to other conflicts that have all the characteristics of war whether carried out within the confines of one country or not There is two criteria to distinguish noninternational armed conflicts from lower forms of violence The level of violence has to be of certain intensity for example when the state cannot contain the situation with regular police forces Also involved nonstate groups need to have a certain level of organization like a military command structureThe other Geneva Conventions are not applicable in this situation but only the provisions contained within Article  and additionally within the language of Protocol II The rationale for the limitation is to avoid conflict with the rights of Sovereign States that were not part of the treaties When the provisions of this article apply it states thatPersons taking no active part in the hostilities including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness wounds detention or any other cause shall in all circumstances be treated humanely without any adverse distinction founded on race colour religion or faith sex birth or wealth or any other similar criteria To this end the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the abovementioned personsviolence to life and person in particular murder of all kinds mutilation cruel treatment and torturetaking of hostagesoutrages upon dignity in particular humiliating and degrading treatment andthe passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoplesThe wounded and sick shall be collected and cared forEnforcementeditProtecting powerseditSee also Protecting powerThe term protecting power has a specific meaning under these Conventions A protecting power is a state that is not taking part in the armed conflict but that has agreed to look after the interests of a state that is a party to the conflict The protecting power is a mediator enabling the flow of communication between the parties to the conflict The protecting power also monitors implementation of these Conventions such as by visiting the zone of conflict and prisoners of war The protecting power must act as an advocate for prisoners the wounded and civiliansGrave breacheseditLogo of International Criminal CourtNot all violations of the treaty are treated equally The most serious crimes are termed grave breaches and provide a legal definition of a war crime Grave breaches of the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions include the following acts if committed against a person protected by the conventionwillful killing torture or inhumane treatment including biological experimentswillfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or healthcompelling a protected person to serve in the armed forces of a hostile powerwillfully depriving a protected person of the right to a fair trial if accused of a war crimeAlso considered grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention are the followingtaking of hostagesextensive destruction and appropriation of property not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonlyunlawful deportation transfer or confinementNations who are party to these treaties must enact and enforce legislation penalizing any of these crimes Nations are also obligated to search for persons alleged to commit these crimes or persons having ordered them to be committed and to bring them to trial regardless of their nationality and regardless of the place where the crimes took placeThe principle of universal jurisdiction also applies to the enforcement of grave breaches when the UN Security Council asserts its authority and jurisdiction from the UN Charter to apply universal jurisdiction The UNSC did this when they established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to investigate andor prosecute alleged violationsLegacyeditAlthough warfare has changed dramatically since the Geneva Conventions of  they are still considered the cornerstone of contemporary international humanitarian law They protect combatants who find themselves hors de combat and they protect civilians caught up in the zone of war These treaties came into play for all recent international armed conflicts including the War in Afghanistan the  invasion of Iraq the invasion of Chechnya present and the  War in Georgia The Geneva Conventions also protect those affected by noninternational armed conflicts such as the Syrian Civil Wardubious  discussThe lines between combatants and civilians have blurred when the actors are not exclusively High Contracting Parties HCP Since the fall of the Soviet Union an HCP often is faced with a nonstate actor as argued by General Wesley Clark in  Examples of such conflict include the Sri Lankan Civil War the Sudanese Civil War and the Colombian Armed Conflict as well as most military engagements of the US since Some scholars hold that Common Article  deals with these situations supplemented by Protocol II dubious  discuss These set out minimum legal standards that must be followed for internal conflicts International tribunals particularly the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ICTY have clarified international law in this area In the  Prosecutor v Dusko Tadic judgement the ICTY ruled that grave breaches apply not only to international conflicts but also to internal armed conflictdubious  discuss Further those provisions are considered customary international lawControversy has arisen over the US designation of irregular opponents as unlawful enemy combatants see also unlawful combatant especially in the SCOTUS judgments over the Guantanamo Bay brig facility Hamdi v Rumsfeld Hamdan v Rumsfeld and Rasul v Bush and later Boumediene v Bush President George W Bush aided by AttorneysGeneral John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales and General Keith B Alexander claimed the power as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces to determine that any person including an American citizen who is suspected of being a member agent or associate of Al Qaeda the Taliban or possibly any other terrorist organization is an enemy combatant who can be detained in US military custody until hostilities end pursuant to the international law of warThe application of the Geneva Conventions to the  conflict in Ukraine Crimea is a troublesome problem because some of the personnel who engaged in combat against the Ukrainians were not identified by insignia although they did wear militarystyle fatigues The types of comportment qualified as acts of perfidy under jus in bello doctrine are listed in Articles  through  of the Geneva Convention the prohibition of fake insignia is listed at Article  but the law is silent on the complete absence of insignia The status of POW captured in this circumstance remains a questionEducational institutions and organizations including Harvard University the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Rohr Jewish Learning Institute use the Geneva Convention as a primary text investigating torture and warfare`

Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't.
I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
"What's the difference?"
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!
That's awful.
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!
 All right, launch positions!

Ever see pollination up close?
No, sir.
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.
See that? It's a little bit of magic.
That's amazing. Why do we do that?
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.
Cool.

God moved upon the face ofthe waters And God said Let there be light and there was light And God saw the light that it was good and God divided thelight from the darkness And God called the light Day and the darkness he calledNight And the evening and the morning were the first day And God said Let there be a firmament in the midst of thewaters and let it divide the waters from the waters And God made the firmament and divided the waters whichwere under the firmament from the waters which were above thefirmament and it was so And God called the firmament Heaven And the evening and themorning were the second day And God said Let the waters under the heaven be gatheredtogether unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so And God called the dry land Earth and the gatheringtogether of the waters called he Seas and God saw that it was good And God said Let the earth bring forth grass the herbyielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whoseseed is in itself upon the earth and it was so And the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seedafter his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itselfafter his kind and God saw that it was good And the evening and the morning were the third day And God said Let there be lights in the firmament of theheaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs andfor seasons and for days and years And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven togive light upon the earth and it was so And God made two great lights the greater light to rule theday and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to givelight upon the earth And to rule over the day and over the night and to dividethe light from the darkness and God saw that it was good And the evening and the morning were the fourth day And God said Let the waters bring forth abundantly themoving creature that hath life and fowl that may fly above the earthin the open firmament of heaven And God created great whales and every living creature thatmoveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kindand every winged fowl after his kind and God saw that it was good And God blessed them saying Be fruitful and multiply andfill the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth And the evening and the morning were the fifth day And God said Let the earth bring forth the living creatureafter his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earthafter his kind and it was so And God made the beast of the earth after his kind andcattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earthafter his kind and God saw that it was good And God said Let us make man in our image after ourlikeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and overthe fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth andover every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth So God created man in his own image in the image of Godcreated he him male and female created he them And God blessed them and God said unto them Be fruitfuland multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominionover the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over everyliving thing that moveth upon the earth And God said Behold I have given you every herb bearingseed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in thewhich is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be formeat And to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of theair and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there islife I have given every green herb for meat and it was so And God saw every thing that he had made and behold itwas very good And the evening and the morning were the sixth day Thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all thehost of them And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had madeand he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it becausethat in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made These are the generations of the heavens and of the earthwhen they were created in the day that the LORD God made the earth andthe heavens And every plant of the field before it was in the earth andevery herb of the field before it grew for the LORD God had not causedit to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground But there went up a mist from the earth and watered thewhole face of the ground And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground andbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a livingsoul And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden andthere he put the man whom he had formed And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every treethat is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life alsoin the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil And a river went out of Eden to water the garden and fromthence it was parted and became into four heads The name of the first is Pison that is it which compasseththe whole land of Havilah where there is gold And the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and theonyx stone And the name of the second river is Gihon the same is itthat compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia And the name of the third river is Hiddekel that is itwhich goeth toward the east of Assyria And the fourth river isEuphrates And the LORD God took the man and put him into the gardenof Eden to dress it and to keep it And the LORD God commanded the man saying Of every tree ofthe garden thou mayest freely eat But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thoushalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shaltsurely die And the LORD God said It is not good that the man should bealone I will make him an help meet for him And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of thefield and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to seewhat he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every livingcreature that was the name thereof And Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of theair and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not foundan help meet for him And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam andhe slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh insteadthereof And the rib which the LORD God had taken from man made hea woman and brought her unto the man And Adam said This is now bone of my bones and flesh of myflesh she shall be called Woman because she was taken out of Man Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother andshall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh And they were both naked the man and his wife and were notashamed Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the fieldwhich the LORD God had made And he said unto the woman Yea hath Godsaid Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden And the woman said unto the serpent We may eat of the fruitof the trees of the garden But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of thegarden God hath said Ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touchit lest ye die And the serpent said unto the woman Ye shall not surelydie For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then youreyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food andthat it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make onewise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also untoher husband with her and he did eat And the eyes of them both were opened and they knew thatthey were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and madethemselves aprons And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in thegarden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselvesfrom the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden And the LORD God called unto Adam and said unto him Whereart thou And he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I wasafraid because I was naked and I hid myself And he said Who told thee that thou wast naked Hast thoueaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest noteat And the man said The woman whom thou gavest to be with meshe gave me of the tree and I did eat And the LORD God said unto the woman What is this that thouhast done And the woman said The serpent beguiled me and I did eat And the LORD God said unto the serpent Because thou hastdone this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast ofthe field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat allthe days of thy life And I will put enmity between thee and the woman andbetween thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shaltbruise his heel Unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrowand thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thydesire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee And unto Adam he said Because thou hast hearkened unto thevoice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which I commandedthee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thysake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee andthou shalt eat the herb of the field In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thoureturn unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thouart and unto dust shalt thou return And Adam called his wifes name Eve because she was themother of all living Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coatsof skins and clothed them And the LORD God said Behold the man is become as one ofus to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand andtake also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden ofEden to till the ground from whence he was taken So he drove out the man and he placed at the east of thegarden of Eden Cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every wayto keep the way of the tree of life And Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived and bareCain and said I have gotten a man from the LORD And she again bare his brother Abel And Abel was a keeperof sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought ofthe fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD And Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock andof the fat thereof And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to hisoffering But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect AndCain was very wroth and his countenance fell And the LORD said unto Cain Why art thou wroth and why isthy countenance fallen If thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thoudoest not well sin lieth at the door And unto thee shall be hisdesire and thou shalt rule over him And Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to passwhen they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel hisbrother and slew him And the LORD said unto Cain Where is Abel thy brother Andhe said I know not Am I my brothers keeper And he said What hast thou done the voice of thy brothersblood crieth unto me from the ground And now art thou cursed from the earth which hath openedher mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand When thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yieldunto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in theearth And Cain said unto the LORD My punishment is greater than Ican bear Behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face ofthe earth and from thy face shall I be hid and I shall be a fugitiveand a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every onethat findeth me shall slay me And the LORD said unto him Therefore whosoever slayethCain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold And the LORD set amark upon Cain lest any finding him should kill him And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and dweltin the land of Nod on the east of Eden And Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare Enochand he builded a city and called the name of the city after the nameof his son Enoch And unto Enoch was born Irad and Irad begat Mehujael andMehujael begat Methusael and Methusael begat Lamech And Lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one wasAdah and the name of the other Zillah And Adah bare Jabal he was the father of such as dwell intents and of such as have cattle And his brothers name was Jubal he was the father of allsuch as handle the harp and organ And Zillah she also bare Tubalcain an instructor of everyartificer in brass and iron and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah And Lamech said unto his wives Adah and Zillah Hear myvoice ye wives of Lamech hearken unto my speech for I have slain aman to my wounding and a young man to my hurt If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly Lamech seventy andsevenfold And Adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and calledhis name Seth For God said she hath appointed me another seedinstead of Abel whom Cain slew And to Seth to him also there was born a son and he calledhis name Enos then began men to call upon the name of the LORD This is the book of the generations of Adam In the day thatGod created man in the likeness of God made he him Male and female created he them and blessed them andcalled their name Adam in the day when they were created And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a sonin his own likeness and after his image and called his name Seth And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eighthundred years and he begat sons and daughters And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred andthirty years and he died And Seth lived an hundred and five years and begat

he died And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years and begata son And he called his name Noah saying This same shall comfortus concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the groundwhich the LORD hath cursed And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety andfive years and begat sons and daughters And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy andseven years and he died And Noah was five hundred years old and Noah begat ShemHam and Japheth And it came to pass when men began to multiply on the faceof the earth and daughters were born unto them That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they werefair and they took them wives of all which they chose And the LORD said My spirit shall not always strive withman for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred andtwenty years There were giants in the earth in those days and also afterthat when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and theybare children to them the same became mighty men which were of oldmen of renown And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in theearth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was onlyevil continually And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earthand it grieved him at his heart And the LORD said I will destroy man whom I have createdfrom the face of the earth both man and beast and the creepingthing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that I have madethem But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD These are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man andperfect in his generations and Noah walked with God And Noah begat three sons Shem Ham and Japheth The earth also was corrupt before God and the earth wasfilled with violence And God looked upon the earth and behold it was corruptfor all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth And God said unto Noah The end of all flesh is come beforeme for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold Iwill destroy them with the earth Make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make inthe ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of Thelength of the ark shall be three hundred cubits the breadth of itfifty cubits and the height of it thirty cubits A window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shaltthou finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in theside thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it And behold I even I do bring a flood of waters upon theearth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from underheaven and every thing that is in the earth shall die But with thee will I establish my covenant and thou shaltcome into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sonswives with thee And of every living thing of all flesh two of every sortshalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shallbe male and female Of fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kindof every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sortshall come unto thee to keep them alive And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thoushalt gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and forthem Thus did Noah according to all that God commanded him sodid he And the LORD said unto Noah Come thou and all thy houseinto the ark for thee have I seen righteous before me in thisgeneration Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens themale and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the maleand his female Of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the femaleto keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth For yet seven days and I will cause it to rain upon theearth forty days and forty nights and every living substance that Ihave made will I destroy from off the face of the earth And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waterswas upon the earth And Noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sonswives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood Of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and offowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark the maleand the female as God had commanded Noah And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of theflood were upon the earth In the six hundredth year of Noahs life in the secondmonth the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all thefountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven wereopened And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights In the selfsame day entered Noah and Shem and Ham andJapheth the sons of Noah and Noahs wife and the three wives of hissons with them into the ark They and every beast after his kind and all the cattleafter their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earthafter his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird of everysort And they went in unto Noah into the ark two and two of allflesh wherein is the breath of life And they that went in went in male and female of all fleshas God had commanded him and the LORD shut him in And the flood was forty days upon the earth and the watersincreased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth And the waters prevailed and were increased greatly uponthe earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and allthe high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and themountains were covered And all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowland of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepethupon the earth and every man All in whose nostrils was the breath of life of all thatwas in the dry land died And every living substance was destroyed which was upon theface of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things andthe fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth andNoah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fiftydays And God remembered Noah and every living thing and all thecattle that was with him in the ark and God made a wind to pass overthe earth and the waters asswaged The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heavenwere stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained And the waters returned from off the earth continually andafter the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated And the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenthday of the month upon the mountains of Ararat And the waters decreased continually until the tenth monthin the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of themountains seen And it came to pass at the end of forty days that Noahopened the window of the ark which he had made And he sent forth a raven which went forth to and frountil the waters were dried up from off the earth Also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waterswere abated from off the face of the ground But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and shereturned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of thewhole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled herin unto him into the ark And he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forththe dove out of the ark And the dove came in to him in the evening and lo in hermouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so Noah knew that the waters wereabated from off the earth And he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dovewhich returned not again unto him any more And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year inthe first month the first day of the month the waters were dried upfrom off the earth and Noah removed the covering of the ark andlooked and behold the face of the ground was dry And in the second month on the seven and twentieth day ofthe month was the earth dried And God spake unto Noah saying Go forth of the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons andthy sons wives with thee Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with theeof all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thingthat creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in theearth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth And Noah went forth and his sons and his wife and hissons wives with him Every beast every creeping thing and every fowl andwhatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth outof the ark And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD and took of everyclean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings onthe altar And the LORD smelled a sweet savour and the LORD said inhis heart I will not again curse the ground any more for mans sakefor the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth neither willI again smite any more every thing living as I have done While the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and coldand heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease And God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them Befruitful and multiply and replenish the earth And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon everybeast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all thatmoveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into yourhand are they delivered Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you evenas the green herb have I given you all things But flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereofshall ye not eat And surely your blood of your lives will I require at thehand of every beast will I require it and at the hand of man at thehand of every mans brother will I require the life of man Whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shedfor in the image of God made he man And you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forthabundantly in the earth and multiply therein And God spake unto Noah and to his sons with him saying And I behold I establish my covenant with you and withyour seed after you And with every living creature that is with you of thefowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from allthat go out of the ark to every beast of the earth And I will establish my covenant with you neither shall allflesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall thereany more be a flood to destroy the earth And God said This is the token of the covenant which I makebetween me and you and every living creature that is with you forperpetual generations I do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token ofa covenant between me and the earth And it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over theearth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud And I will remember my covenant which is between me and youand every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no morebecome a flood to destroy all flesh And the bow shall be in the cloud and I will look upon itthat I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and everyliving creature of all flesh that is upon the earth And God said unto Noah This is the token of the covenantwhich I have established between me and all flesh that is upon theearth And the sons of Noah that went forth of the ark were Shemand Ham and Japheth and Ham is the father of Canaan These are the three sons of Noah and of them was the wholeearth overspread And Noah began to be an husbandman and he planted avineyard And he drank of the wine and was drunken and he wasuncovered within his tent And Ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of hisfather and told his two brethren without And Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon boththeir shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of theirfather and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathersnakedness And Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger sonhad done unto him And he said Cursed be Canaan a servant of servants shallhe be unto his brethren And he said Blessed be the LORD God of Shem and Canaanshall be his servant God shall enlarge Japheth and he shall dwell in the tentsof Shem and Canaan shall be his servant And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fiftyyears And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty yearsand he died Now these are the
